I utilized Chatgpt system prompts for all three exercises and made modifications to each system prompt. For the briefing note, I noticed the LLM used its creative generative response output capabilities to come up with recommended IT steps for the IT technician to take to resolve the IT ticket.  In the refusal guardrail, I modified the JSON Jira ticket with missing device and user information and noticed it refused the IT ticket due to missing parameters.  Lastly, for the staleness guardrail, I changed the JSON Jira ticket's service level agreement if the IT Ticket was more than 3 days as well as if the ticket was created more than 3 days, then it would send a reminder notification to the IT Help Desk Team to either update, close, or follow up with the user."],"metadata":{"id":"JzsUi6aREKG-"}}]}
